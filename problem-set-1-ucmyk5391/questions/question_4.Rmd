# Randomization and Experiments 

The following questions can be a little bit challenging. This is because the argument that you are being asked to make is based on the rote application of a definition. To begin with, it is useful for you to define what you mean when you write about either *an experiment* or *an observational study*. Then, with these definitions on hand, use the definitions to answer the following questions. 

## Define your terms 

- **An experiment is:** a study in which the researcher controls the assignment of treatment to participants using a randomization process. This random assignment ensures that the treatment and control groups are comparable in terms of observed and unobserved characteristics.
- **An experiment provides the following statistical guarantees:**
 1. Unbiased estimates of treatment effects if conducted properly.
 2. Eliminates confounding due to random assignment.
 3. Allows causal inference by ensuring comparability between treatment and control groups.
- **An observational study is:** a study in which the researcher observes and measures variables of interest without controlling or randomizing the assignment of treatments. Assignment to treatment or control is determined by natural conditions, choices, or external factors.
- **An observational study provides the following statistical guarantees:**
 1. No guarantees of unbiased treatment effect estimates.
 2. Susceptible to confounding from unobserved variables.
 3. Causal inference is limited unless strong assumptions (e.g., no unobserved confounding) are justified.

## Does a random, iid sample produce an unbiased treatment effect estimate?
Assume that a researcher takes a random sample of elementary school children and compares the grades of those who were previously enrolled in an early childhood education program with the grades of those who were not enrolled in such a program. Is this an experiment, an observational study, or something in between? 
  
**Answer:** This is an observational study because the researcher does not control or randomize the assignment of treatment (early childhood education). Instead, the treatment (enrollment in the program) was determined by external factors (e.g., parental choice or availability).

## What if an official agency produces the idd sample? 
Assume that the researcher works together with an organization that provides early childhood education and offer free programs to certain children. However, which children that received this offer was not randomly selected by the researcher but rather chosen by the local government. (Assume that the government did not use random assignment but instead gives the offer to students who are deemed to need it the most) The research follows up a couple of years later by comparing the elementary school grades of students offered free early childhood education to those who were not. Is this an experiment, an observational study, or something in between? Explain!  

**Answer:** 
This is an observational study, not an experiment because although the researcher collaborates with an official agency, the assignment to treatment is still not random; it is determined by the governmentâ€™s criteria (e.g., children deemed most in need). This introduces potential confounding variables that may bias the treatment effect estimate.

## What if someone else randomly assigns 
If the government assigned students to treatment and control by "coin toss", rather than simply sampling the population, would you say that the study is experimental or observational? Why? What, if any guarantees does this process provide?

**Answer:** 
This is an experiment because the treatment assignment is random. Random assignment ensures that treatment and control groups are comparable in expectation, eliminating confounding and allowing for causal inference.
